                <h1>Confession of Faith</h1>
                <p>We believe in God omnipotent, Creator of the universe. We believe in the Trinity, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. We believe Jesus Christ came down as God incarnate and died on the cross as perfect atonement for our sins. We believe Christ rose from the grave after 3 days and is now seated at the right hand of the father. We believe that Christ will come again and judge the wicked from the righteous.</p>

                <p>Members are called to join one of our small group ministries where we believe true evangelism can take place by reaching out to people in our personal lives.
